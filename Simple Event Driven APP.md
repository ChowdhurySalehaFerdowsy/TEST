This project creates a basic serverless event-driven app using AWS SQS, Lambda and DynamoDB. 
Here we are able to send messages using AWS CLI to AWS SQS and whenever SQS has any 
item arrived in its queue, it will trigger Lambda function and send it to DynamoDB table and CloudWatch logs.

## **STEPS**
### 1. Install AWS CLI and configure for the AWS account
- Use your account in AWS 
- Install AWS CLI in your local machine ex. laptop/desktop
- Open terminal and Configure AWS CLI using access key 
- Set region name : `us-east-1`
- Default output can be left empty

### 2. Go to AWS DynamoDB and create table 
- Table name : `ProductVisits`
- Partition key: `ProductVisitKey`

### 3. Go to AWS SQS and Create SQS Queue
- Select Type as `Standard`
- Table name : `ProductVisitsDataQueue`
- After creating the queue, note the queue URL
### 4. Go to AWS Lambda and create function
- Type Name: `productVisitsDataHandler`
- Select Runtime: `Node.js 12.x`
- From Role section select : `create new role from templates`
- Put Role name as  `lambdaRoleForSQSPermissions`
- We will add two policies for this role : `Simple microservice permissions` and `Amazon SQS poller permissions` and create function
- After creating Lambda function we will upload a zip file . In the action menu there is a `upload` option , select zip file there.
- Upload a zip file (DCTProductVisitsTracking.zip)
> At this point we will give a command in AWS CLI to see if SQS can poll messages 

### 5. Go to AWS CLI and send messages to SQS:
- In your computer go to the file location where all the codes of this project have been saved.  
I am using windows OS , so I used  `cd` command to go the location and `dir` command to see the listing. You can alternatively go to the location of the code and then open terminal from that directory.
- Once you are in that file location use AWS CLI Command as follows : 
`aws sqs send-message --queue-url *QUEUE URL*--message-body file://message-body-1.json`
- In the *QUEUE URL* of the command use the SQS URL copied earlier from SQS  
If it returna something with message ID , it means it is working 
### 6. Configure SQS to trigger Lambda function
- Go to SQS queue and go to the `ProductVisitsDataQueue`. At the right side there is option from poll messages. Select `Poll message`.   
   - One message will be received . If we click on the message we can the details of the message including the message of the body  
   - We can do this multiple times changing the command in AWS CLI (as shown in step 5). For example instead of `message-body-1` we can type `message -body-2` and so on.
- Go to `Lambda trigger` and configure Lambda function . Specify Lambda function with name: `productVisitsDataHandler`
- Now again poll for messages and we will see no message is receiving . This is because we have configured Lambda function and it is now sending the messages in DynamoDB table.

### 7. Find items in DynamoDB table 
-  Go to AWS Dynamo DB and select `explore items` from left menu
- Select `ProductVisits` table we can see items in the DynamoDB table 

### 8.	Find log stream in CloudWatch Logs
- Go to AWS cloud watch and click on `log groups`
- Select the log stream that has a name with `productVisitsDataHandler` and open it. We will see all the events for each invocation from Lambda
